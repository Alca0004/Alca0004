## Hello! I'm Aaron ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end web developer with a passion for creating clean, minimalist websites that focus on usability and design. Currently, Iâ€™m taking a bootcamp with CodeSpace to level up my skills and dive deeper into JavaScript and modern web development techniques.

I love building projects that push my creativity and problem-solving skills while focusing on delivering intuitive, engaging user experiences. Whether it's experimenting with new frameworks, fine-tuning my CSS, or perfecting a JavaScript function, Iâ€™m always looking to improve and learn something new.
